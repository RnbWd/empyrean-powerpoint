Hi David,

I have included the instructions Carlos wanted me to forward to you for the presentation for the senior front-end engineer position. If you have any questions about the project feel free to reach back out to me J

Prompt: Write the frontend to a presentation app using the technology of your choice. The app should be stripped down version of PowerPoint with the contents of the slides written using markdown.

At a minimum:

The app should be able to move forward/backwards in the presentation.
Parse and display the markdown code.
Create a presentation covering:
The pros/cons of the framework or approach used
The architecture of the application
Any design considerations
Any challenges faced or takeaways

Extra Points!!!

Editing and saving the slides thru an editor
Storing slides in a backend service
Highlighting/formatting code snippets
Supporting different slide layouts
displaying a presentation progress bar
Implementing hotkeys support
Implementing a mobile-friendly design
